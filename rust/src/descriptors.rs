/// heap-allocated — so its address is a link-time constant that lies outside both
/// semispaces by construction. The symbol denotes the object itself; codegen
/// references its address directly (no load) to initialize String-typed fields to
/// their LO default (the empty string).
///
/// This replaces the WS-1 init-time allocation: `lo_runtime_init` no longer
/// allocates the empty string. Because it is never *in* from-space, the
/// collector's `forward` range-check returns it untouched with no special case
/// (runbook WS-2 §2.5), and being read-only storage, a buggy collector that
/// forgot to range-guard before writing its header would fault loudly rather than
/// corrupt a shared object.
///
/// A zero-length string has no inline tail, so the whole object is a fixed
/// compile-time constant. `StringObject` carries a raw pointer (in its `Object`
/// header), so it is not `Sync` by default — but this instance is immutable
/// read-only data on the single runtime thread, so the `unsafe impl Sync` below
/// is sound, exactly as for the class descriptors above.
