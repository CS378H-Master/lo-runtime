//! Shadow-stack root tracking (`runtime-abi.md` §3.3).
//!
//! Roots live in a linked list of stack-allocated [`ShadowFrame`]s. Codegen lays
//! out a frame at function entry, registers it, updates `roots[i]` at safepoints,
//! and unregisters at exit. The runtime keeps a single `current_frame` head; push
//! links the new frame's `parent` to it and pop restores the parent.
//!
//! `CURRENT_FRAME` is `static mut` (the runbook sanctions `static mut` for the
//! root-list head). Access is by value only — never `&`/`&mut` of the static —
//! so the `static_mut_refs` lint stays quiet. Invariant: single-threaded; only
//! the functions here mutate the head.
